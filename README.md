A multi-page responsive website built with HTML and CSS to showcase a fictional Renaissance Faire. This project was created as part of my web developer bootcamp and features reusable components, semantic structure, and a modal-based contact form for improved user experience.

## 🎨 Design Theme

The visual style (hopefully) reflects the aesthetic of a renaissance faire, using parchment-style backgrounds, medieval-style fonts (via Google Fonts), and thematic imagery.

## 📱 Responsive Design

This site was designed with a mobile-first approach and adapts gracefully to various screen sizes using CSS flexbox and media queries.
